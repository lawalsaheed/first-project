        <h1>Thr story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk,
             lying between the copies of <cite>Nature,New scientist,</cite>  and all the other scientific
              journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favotite booksince college, and the longer she spent in this four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
               
               <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting under a poster with an Oscar 
                Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. 
                Although many considered her pioneering work,unravelling the secrets of the Ilama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>
                to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she something better to do.</p>
